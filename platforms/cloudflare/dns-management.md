# DNS Management

CloudFlare provides a fast and really easy interface to update your DNS records. 

Click on the DNS tab to get started: ![DNS tab](images/dns-tab.jpg "DNS tab")

## DNS Records

This panel shows your domains DNS records. You may update these as much as you would like, the changes should be reflected 
almost immediately. If you are adding A, AAAA, or CNAME records you can optionally route these through the CloudFlare network
for enhanced performance and security by making sure the cloud is orange.

* Orange cloud - CloudFlare is routing the traffic through its network.
* Grey cloud - CloudFlare is only active as a DNS and is not routing the traffic through its network.
