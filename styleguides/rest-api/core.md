#  REST APIs

There are many ways to write an API just like there are many ways to skin a cat, like most people we have our preferred way of getting the job done. All of our APIs follow REST architecture & return JSON as a rule of thumb, there might be times when we are required to work with other architecuture or return types but those are few and far between.

_This is still a work in progress_
