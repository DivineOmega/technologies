### Setting up an Artboard

#### Desktop

The default settings for a desktop artboard is:

Artboard width: 1920
- Recommended workspace view: 1200
   - **Grid settings for default Bootstrap website (closest setting)**
   - Grid: Layout
   - Columns: 12
   - Gutter width: 30
   - Column Width: 72
   - Linked Margin: 366

   - **Grid setting for fluid Bootstrap website**
   - Linked Margin: 3

Viewport height (default): 1080

**Draggable guides** can be created by hovering over the left and top of the artboard and then dragging onto it.


#### Tablet / Mobile

The project specifications should document which tablet/mobile devices, the app will be primarily used on.
If the requirements are based on multiple resolutions, design to the smallest device as it is easier to scale upwards instead of down (mobile first design).
- Create multiple sizes of resolutions if needed.
- The smallest screen size should be optimised for an iPhone 5.


### Assets

When creating a new project, you should set up global/reusable assets. This will help keep the design style constant and save valuable time when creating large projects.

The following assets can be created:

**Colors**

Place all brand / reusable colours here.

**Character Styles**

Create all typography styles here.

**Components**

Create components such as navigation bars, buttons, cards or any other reusable element here.

_'Master'_ components - These are the main components which when edited, all child components will be edited in the project.

_'Child'_ components - These are copies of the Master Components but can be edited without affecting the master or other child components. eg. change component colour


### Prototyping

After creating a design, you should create a prototype version which will allow users to navigation through the wireframes. This will allow you to test the user flow to make sure everything makes sense and is in the correct position.
Having a working prototype will allow the sales team guide clients through what the end product will look like.

Broken / missing links will cause the artboard to be hidden from view when exporting n prototype and developer view.


### Exporting

Once the wireframes and prototypes are complete, you can export into the following views:

**PDF**

Produces a PDF version of selected artboards which can be easily emailed.

**Share for Review**

Creates a prototype version of the app / website which clients can navigate through. Clients can create and pin comments to the wireframes to request changes etc.

**Share for Development**

Creates an overview of the project where you can see a detailed view of the page. This will show the colour pallet, typography, assets(with download option), all styling options and interaction / navigation links.
